#Typles are very similar to lists. HOwever they have no key difference - immutability. Once an element is inside a tuple, it cannot be reassigned, they use parentesis ()

t = (1,2,3,1)
print(t.count(1)) # We can use .count to check how many times is a number repeated 

#Note -> at the beggining you are not going to use Tuples, this is just the "endcontent" because it's actually better to use lists
